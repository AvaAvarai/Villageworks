# About Villageworks

## Overview

Villageworks is a village building simulation game where you manage resources, build villages, and create road networks to optimize production. As a god-like entity, you direct villagers to construct buildings, gather resources, and expand your civilization.

## Game Philosophy

Villageworks aims to provide a relaxing yet engaging simulation experience where players can experiment with different village layouts and resource management strategies. The game emphasizes organic growth and interconnected systems rather than combat or competition.
