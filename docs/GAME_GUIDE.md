## Getting Started

### Your First Village

When starting a new game, you'll have 100 money, 50 wood, 30 stone, and 40 food. To place your first village:

1. Click the green "Build Village" button in the top-right corner of the screen
2. Click anywhere on the map to place the village (costs $50 and 20 wood)

Villages are the core of your civilization. Each new village will automatically receive a unique historical name (like Alexandria, Kyoto, or Carthage) and begin generating builders if you have enough food.

### Early Priorities

1. **Houses**: Builders prioritize houses, which are essential for population growth
2. **Resource Buildings**: Farm/Fishing Hut (food), Lumberyard (wood), Mine (stone)
3. **Roads**: Connect your resource buildings to villages for efficiency

## Resource Management

### Resource Types

- **Food**: Required to spawn builders. Villages consume 5 food to produce each builder.
- **Wood**: Primary building material, used for all structures.
- **Stone**: Secondary building material, used especially for advanced buildings.
- **Money**: Earned from resource production, used to found new villages.

### Production Buildings

| Building    | Resources Required      | Production           | Notes                          |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Farm        | 15 wood, 10 stone       | Food                 | Requires workers               |
| Fishing Hut | 25 wood, 5 stone        | Food                 | Higher production than farms   |
| Lumberyard  | 10 wood, 10 stone       | Wood                 | Essential for expansion        |
| Mine        | 10 wood, 25 stone       | Stone                | Higher stone cost, good output |
| House       | 15 wood, 5 stone        | Villagers, capacity  | Provides +3 population capacity|

### Resource Transport

Resources are not automatically added to your stockpile. Villagers must extract resources at buildings and then carry them back to the village. Roads significantly improve this process by:

- Increasing villager movement speed
- Boosting resource carrying capacity (50% bonus with roads)

## Village Growth

### Population System

- **Base Capacity**: Each village starts with a capacity for 5 units
- **Builders**: Limited to 3 by default, but can exceed this if housing is built
- **Houses**: Each house adds capacity for 3 more villagers
- **Growth**: Villagers spawn automatically from houses over time

### Housing Urgency

The game provides visual feedback about housing needs through village colors:

- **Green**: Adequate housing
- **Orange**: Housing needed soon (population at 70-90% of capacity)
- **Red**: Critical housing shortage (population above 90% of capacity)

## Building Strategy

### Optimal Building Placement

- Houses should be built near villages for faster population growth
- Resource buildings benefit from being connected by roads
- New villages should be placed near abundant resources

### Building Priority

Builders use this priority order:

1. Houses (if needed or for proactive growth)
2. Roads based on village needs
3. Resource buildings based on shortages
4. Additional buildings

## Road Networks

### Planning Roads

1. Open the build menu (press B)
2. Click "Plan Road"
3. Select your starting village
4. Select the destination village

Roads must be built by builders and require resources (wood and stone) proportional to their length. They aren't created instantly - they're added to the village's priority list for builders to construct.

### Road Benefits

- **Movement Speed**: Units move 50% faster on roads
- **Resource Transport**: 50% increase in carrying capacity
- **Village Connections**: Allows sharing of resources between villages

## Advanced Tips

### Managing Multiple Villages

- Use number keys (1-9) to quickly select and switch between villages
- Establish road connections between close villages
- Specialize villages for different resources (farming village, mining village, etc.)

### Population Optimization

- Maintain a good ratio of builders to villagers (around 1:3)
- Build houses proactively before reaching capacity
- Ensure food production keeps pace with population growth

### Efficient Resource Flow

- Connect all production buildings to villages with roads
- Shorter roads are more resource-efficient to build
- Prioritize connecting buildings that have workers assigned

### Time Acceleration

- Hold the SPACEBAR to accelerate game time (3x normal speed)
- Use this to speed through construction periods or when waiting for resources
- The camera still moves at normal speed during acceleration
- A "FAST FORWARD" indicator appears when active

## Game Controls

### Basic Controls

- **Left Mouse Button**: Select villages, place buildings, interact with UI
- **Right Mouse Button**: Deselect current village, cancel building mode
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the camera
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **SPACEBAR**: Hold to accelerate game time (3x speed)
- **ESC**: Cancel current action, close menus

### Building Controls

- **B Key**: Open/close build menu
- **Build Village Button**: Top-right corner, starts village placement mode
- **Plan Road Button**: In build menu, starts road planning mode

### Village Management

- **1-9 Keys**: Quickly select villages by index
